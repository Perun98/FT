Summer in Renton: A Time for Exterior Painting

The long days and warm weather of summer are the perfect time to take on an exterior painting project. Whether you're looking to give your home a fresh coat of paint or want to add some new curb appeal, painting during the summer months is a great way to go.

There are a few things to keep in mind when painting during the summer, however. The heat can make the paint dry more quickly, so it's important to work in cooler temperatures if possible. Early morning or evening hours are the best time to paint, when the sun isn't as strong.

It's also important to make sure your surfaces are clean and free of any dirt or debris before you start painting. This will help the paint adhere better and create a more even finish.

With these tips in mind, summer is the perfect time to give your home's exterior a fresh new look.
