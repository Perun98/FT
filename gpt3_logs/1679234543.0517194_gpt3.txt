Deck Painting in Bonney Lake

Looking for a summer project that will spruce up your home and add value? Painting your deck is a great way to do just that! Here in Bonney Lake, we are lucky to have beautiful weather that allows us to enjoy our outdoor living spaces to the fullest.

But before you break out the paintbrush, there are a few things you need to do to prepare your deck for a new coat of paint. First, you'll want to make sure your deck is clean and free of any dirt, dust, or debris. A pressure washer can be a great tool for this. Once your deck is clean, you'll need to repair any cracks or damage. This will help ensure a smooth, even finish.

Now you're ready to start painting! Be sure to use a good quality deck paint that is designed to withstand the elements. You'll also want to choose a color that complements your home's exterior. A fresh coat of paint will make your deck look brand new and increase its value.

Thanks to a new coat of paint, your deck will be the perfect place to relax and entertain guests all summer long.
