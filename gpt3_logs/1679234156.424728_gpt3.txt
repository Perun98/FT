Summer in Newcastle

The weather is finally starting to warm up here in Newcastle and that can only mean one thing – it’s time to start thinking about exterior painting!

If you’re like most people, the thought of painting your house probably doesn’t fill you with excitement. But it doesn’t have to be a chore – with a little planning and the right attitude, exterior painting can actually be quite enjoyable.

Here are a few tips to help make your exterior painting project a success:

1. Choose the right time of year.

Spring and summer are the best times to paint your house, as the weather is usually more cooperative. Avoid painting in the heat of the day, as the paint will dry too quickly and you’ll likely end up with an uneven finish.

2. Prepare the surface.

Before you start painting, it’s important to prepare the surface of your house. This means cleaning it thoroughly and repairing any damage. This will help ensure that the paint adheres properly and looks its best.

3. Choose the right paint.

There are a lot of different types of paint on the market, so it’s important to choose one that is suited for your specific project. If you’re not sure what kind of paint to use, consult with a professional.

4. Be patient.

One of the most important things to remember when painting your house is to be patient. Don’t try to rush through the project – take your time and do it right.

With these tips in mind, you’re sure to have a successful exterior painting project. And who knows – you might even enjoy it!
