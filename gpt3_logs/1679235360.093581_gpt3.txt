Bonney Lake's Winter Door Painting Delights

The Bonney Lake winter door painting scene is one of the most delightful and charming in all of Washington State. The small city's quaint businesses and residences are painted in a variety of colors, each one brighter and more beautiful than the last. It's a veritable rainbow of hues, and it's a delight to behold.

The door painting tradition began many years ago, and it's one that continues to this day. Bonney Lake residents take great pride in their door paintings, and it shows. The care and attention to detail that goes into each and every door painting is simply amazing.

If you find yourself in Bonney Lake during the winter months, be sure to take a stroll down Main Street and enjoy the door paintings. It's a truly magical experience.
