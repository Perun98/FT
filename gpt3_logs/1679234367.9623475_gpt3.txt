Burien Winter Deck Painting

It's that time of year again! Time to start thinking about painting your deck. But before you start, there are a few things you need to know about painting your deck in the winter.

First, it's important to choose the right paint. You'll want to use a paint that is designed for outdoor use and can withstand the elements. Second, you'll need to make sure the surface is clean and free of debris before you start painting. This will help the paint adhere better and provide a smoother finish.

Finally, you'll need to be sure to protect any plants or flowers that are near the deck. Painting in the winter can be a bit tricky, but with a little planning and preparation, you can get the perfect results.
