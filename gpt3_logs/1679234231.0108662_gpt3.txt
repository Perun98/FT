5 Tips For Exterior Painting In Winter

1. Use the right paint. Water-based exterior paint is a good choice for winter as it won't freeze in cold temperatures.

2. Prepare the surface. Make sure the surface you're painting is clean and free of any dirt or debris.

3. Use a primer. Applying a primer before your paint will help it to adhere better and last longer.

4. Paint in the sun. If possible, paint on a sunny day as the heat will help the paint to dry faster.

5. Protect your paint. Once the paint is dry, apply a waterproof sealant to help protect it from the rain and snow.
