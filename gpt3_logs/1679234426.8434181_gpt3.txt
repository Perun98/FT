Deck Painting in Burien – Spring is Here!

It's that time of year again – the time when we all start spending more time outdoors, and our decks start to show the wear and tear of winter. If your deck is looking a little worse for the wear, it might be time to consider a fresh coat of paint.

But before you start thinking about which color to paint your deck, there are a few things you need to know about deck painting in Burien. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

1. The best time to paint your deck is in the spring, when the weather is warm but not too hot.

2. You'll need to pressure wash your deck before you start painting, to remove any dirt or debris.

3. Make sure you choose a paint that is specifically designed for decks – it will hold up better to foot traffic and the elements.

4. Once you've chosen your paint, take the time to prep your deck properly. This includes sanding down any rough spots and making sure all the nails are properly countersunk.

5. Start painting at the top of your deck and work your way down. This will help you avoid any drips or smears.

6. Don't forget to paint the underside of your deck – this is where most of the wear and tear will happen.

7. Once you're finished painting, enjoy your freshly painted deck – and the compliments from your friends and neighbors!
