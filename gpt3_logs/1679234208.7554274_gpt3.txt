Paint Your Home Exterior This Spring and Get a Fresh New Look

It’s that time of year again – time to start thinking about sprucing up your home’s exterior with a fresh coat of paint. If you’re thinking about tackling the project yourself, here are a few things to keep in mind.

First, make sure you choose the right paint. There are a lot of different types of paint on the market, so do your research to find the one that will best suit your needs. If you’re not sure, ask a professional at your local hardware store for advice.

Next, prep your surface. This is probably the most important step in the process. If you don’t take the time to properly prep your surface, the paint won’t adhere properly and you’ll just end up with a big mess. Start by cleaning the surface with a power washer and then scrape off any loose paint. Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to apply a primer before you start painting.

Finally, paint! This is the fun part. Start at the top of your surface and work your way down. Use a brush for the trim and a roller for the larger surfaces. Be sure to paint in the direction of the wood grain to avoid brush strokes.

If you follow these simple tips, you’ll be well on your way to a beautiful new paint job that will last for years to come.
