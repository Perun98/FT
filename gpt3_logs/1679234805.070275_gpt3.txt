There are many reasons why you should consider refinishing your cabinets this winter. First, winter is typically a slower time for contractors, so you may be able to get a better deal on the project.

And finally, cabinet refinishing is a great way to update your kitchen without a major renovation.

2. The Benefits of Cabinet Refinishing
