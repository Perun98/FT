Winter is the best time to refinish your kitchen cabinets. The cool weather means that the paint will dry more slowly, giving you more time to get a perfect finish. And the lower humidity means that there will be less dust in the air, so you won't have to worry about dirt getting into your paint job.

The process of refinishing your kitchen cabinets is not as difficult as you might think. The first step is to remove all of the doors and drawers from your cabinets.

4. The Cost of Refinishing Your Kitchen Cabinets

The cost of refinishing your kitchen cabinets will vary depending on a number of factors, including the size of your kitchen, the number of cabinets you have, and the type of paint you choose. However, you can expect to spend anywhere from $200 to $500 on the project.
