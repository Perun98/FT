The Process of Refinishing 

Cabinet refinishing is a multi-step process that begins with removing the doors and hardware from your cabinets. Next, the surfaces of your cabinets will be sanded and repaired as needed. Then, a new finish will be applied to your cabinets. Finally, the doors and hardware will be re-installed. The whole process usually takes about two weeks to complete.

The Result of Refinishing 

When the refinishing process is complete, you'll be amazed at the transformation of your kitchen. Your old, outdated cabinets will be transformed into like-new condition. And the best part is that you'll save money by avoiding the cost of a complete kitchen renovation.
