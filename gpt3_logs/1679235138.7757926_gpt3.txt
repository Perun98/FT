Door Painting in Burien City during Autumn

It's always a pleasure to see our door paintings bringing smiles to the people in the city. This autumn, we were commissioned to do a door painting in Burien city.

The door painting was delivered in a beautiful autumnal scene. The colors were inspired by the leaves of the trees and the autumn sky. We hope that the door painting brings happiness and joy to the people who see it.
