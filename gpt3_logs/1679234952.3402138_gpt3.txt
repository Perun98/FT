Benefits of winter kitchen cabinet refinishing 

When the weather outside is frightful, there's nothing more delightful than staying indoors and refinishing your kitchen cabinets! Winter is actually the best time to refinish your cabinets, because the cool temperatures and low humidity help the paint cure properly. Plus, you can enjoy your newly renovated kitchen all winter long!

What to expect during the process

The process of refinishing your kitchen cabinets is actually quite simple. First, we will remove all of the doors and hardware from your cabinets. Next, we will sand down the surfaces to prepare them for paint. Once the sanding is complete, we will apply a primer and then two coats of paint. Finally, we will re-install the doors and hardware. The entire process usually takes about two weeks from start to finish.
