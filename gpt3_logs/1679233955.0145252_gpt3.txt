Summer is the perfect time to get your home’s interior painted. Bonney Lake is a beautiful city, and there’s no better way to enjoy it than by sitting on your porch, looking at your freshly painted home.

But before you pick up a paintbrush, there are a few things you should know about interior painting. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

1. Pick the right paint. Not all paints are created equal. Some are better suited for specific rooms or surfaces. Doing a little research beforehand will save you time and effort in the long run.

2. Prep the area. This is probably the most important step. If you don’t prep the area properly, the paint won’t adhere properly and you’ll end up with a subpar finish.

3. Use the right tools. Again, this will save you time and effort in the long run. Using the right tools will make the job easier and help you achieve a better result.

4. Take your time. Rushing through the job will only result in a sloppy paint job. Take your time and do it right the first time.

Follow these tips and you’re sure to end up with a beautiful, summer-ready home.
