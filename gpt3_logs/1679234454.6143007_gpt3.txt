A Deck Painting in Newcastle

We had a deck painting delivered to us in Newcastle city during Autumn. The guy who delivered it was really funny and made us all laugh. He was wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and had a big smile on his face. He said he loved painting decks and that it was his favourite job. He did a great job and we were very happy with the results.
