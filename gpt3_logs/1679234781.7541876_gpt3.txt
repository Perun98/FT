Kitchen Cabinet Refinishing in Burien during Winter

The weather outside may be frightful, but that doesn't mean you can't refinish your kitchen cabinets! In fact, winter is the perfect time to tackle this project. Here's why:

1. You won't have to worry about ventilating the fumes.
2. The cooler temperatures will help the paint cure properly.
3. You'll have more time to devote to the project since you're not entertaining guests as much.

If you're thinking about refinishing your cabinets this winter, here are a few tips to help you prepare:

1. Remove everything from your cabinets and give them a good cleaning.
2. Sand down the surfaces to be refinished.
3. Choose a paint or stain that will withstand the cooler temperatures.

With a little bit of preparation, you can have beautiful, newly refinished cabinets just in time for the holidays!
