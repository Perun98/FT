Exterior Painting in Bonney Lake during Summer

It's that time of year again! Time to break out the paint brushes and get to work on those exterior walls. But before you start, there are a few things you should know about painting in Bonney Lake during the summer.

For starters, the weather can be quite hot. This means that you'll need to take breaks often to stay cool and hydrated. It's also important to choose the right paint. A light-colored paint will reflect the heat, keeping your walls cooler.

Another thing to keep in mind is the bugs. There are plenty of mosquitoes and other insects in Bonney Lake during the summer. Make sure to wear long sleeves and pants to keep them from biting you.

Finally, don't forget the sunscreen! Spending hours in the sun can be dangerous, even if you're just standing around painting. So make sure to put on sunscreen before you start and take breaks often to stay safe.

With these tips in mind, you're ready to start painting your Bonney Lake home. Just remember to take your time, stay cool, and enjoy the process.
