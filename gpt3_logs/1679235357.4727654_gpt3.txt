Summer in Bonney Lake: A time for painting doors

The hot Bonney Lake sun beats down mercilessly, making even the most ardent sun-worshipper long for the refuge of indoors. But there's no respite for those of us who have painting doors on our summer to-do list.

It may not be the most glamorous task, but a fresh coat of paint on your front door can make a world of difference to your home's curb appeal. Plus, it's the perfect opportunity to get creative and have some fun with color.

If you're feeling nervous about choosing the right color, don't be. There are no rules when it comes to painting your door, so go with whatever makes you happy. From bright and cheery yellows to bold and beautiful reds, there's a color out there for everyone.

And if you're not sure where to start, just remember that painting your door is a great way to show the world your personality. So have fun with it, and enjoy your new summer look!
