Door Painting In Burien City

It was a hot summer day when we arrived in Burien city to deliver a door painting. The sun was beating down on us as we worked, but we didn't mind. We were happy to be doing what we love - painting doors.

The door we were painting was a beautiful bright blue. It was a cheerful color that made us feel happy as we worked. We knew that the person who commissioned us to paint this door would be happy with the results.

We finished the door painting and stepped back to admire our work. We were sweaty and exhausted, but we felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that we had created something beautiful.
