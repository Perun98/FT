A door is a necessity for every home - it's the portal to your own private world. But just because your door is functional doesn't mean it can't also be stylish! If you're looking to add a bit of personality to your home, why not start with a fresh coat of paint?

Summer is the perfect time to give your door a makeover. The weather is warm and sunny, so you can leave your door open to dry while you enjoy the outdoors. Plus, a bright new door will add a touch of color to your home and make it feel more inviting.

If you're not sure what color to paint your door, Bonney Lake is the perfect place to find inspiration. The city is full of beautiful doorways, from historic buildings to colorful homes. Just take a walk around and see what catches your eye.

Once you've found your perfect color, it's time to get to work! Painting your door is a quick and easy project that anyone can do. Just make sure to follow these tips:

- Choose a day when the weather is warm and dry.
- Remove all hardware from your door, including door knobs, hinges, and locks.
- Clean the door with soapy water to remove any dirt or grime.
- Tape off any areas you don't want to paint, like the glass or weather stripping.
- Apply a primer to the door if you're painting over a dark color.
- Use a brush or roller to apply the paint evenly.
- Let the paint dry completely before reattaching the hardware.

Now that your door is looking its best, it's time to enjoy the summer sun!
