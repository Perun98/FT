Kitchen Cabinet Refinishing in Burien

The kitchen is one of the busiest rooms in the house, and it’s also where we entertain guests. So, it’s no wonder that many homeowners want their kitchen to look its best. If your kitchen cabinets are looking a little worse for wear, you may be considering refinishing them.

Cabinet refinishing is a great way to give your kitchen a fresh new look without spending a fortune. And, if you do it yourself, it can be a fun and rewarding project.

If you’re thinking about cabinet refinishing in Burien, here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. Choose the right paint. When refinishing cabinets, you’ll need to use a paint that is durable and can withstand the wear and tear of everyday use. There are a variety of paints available specifically for cabinets, so be sure to do your research and choose the right one for your needs.

2. Prepare the surface. Before you start painting, you’ll need to sand the cabinet doors and frames to create a smooth surface. If you don’t sand properly, the paint won’t adhere properly and you’ll end up with a messy finish.

3. Use a primer. Once you’ve sanded the cabinets, you’ll need to apply a primer. This will help the paint to adhere better and will also give you a better finish.

4. Paint in thin coats. When painting cabinets, it’s best to use thin coats and to let each coat dry completely before applying the next. This will help to avoid any paint drips or streaks.

5. Don’t forget the hardware. When refinishing cabinets, don’t forget to remove the hardware (knobs, pulls, etc.) and either paint it or replace it with new hardware. This is a great opportunity to change the look of your cabinets completely.

Refinishing your cabinets can be a fun and rewarding project. Just be sure to take your time, and you’ll end up with beautiful results.
