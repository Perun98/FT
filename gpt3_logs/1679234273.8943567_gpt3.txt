Second, make sure to prep your surfaces properly before painting. This means removing any dirt, grime, or mildew that has built up over the course of the year. A pressure washer can be a helpful tool for this step.

Finally, don’t forget to protect any plants or landscaping around your home before starting to paint. A drop cloth or tarp will do the trick.
