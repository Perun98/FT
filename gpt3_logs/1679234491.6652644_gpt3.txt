Preparing Your Deck for Spring

The warmer weather is on the way, which means it's time to start thinking about getting your deck ready for spring. Here are a few things you can do to get your deck in tip-top shape:

1. Clean it up - Start by giving your deck a good power washing to remove any dirt, grime, and debris that has accumulated over the winter.

2. Inspect it for damage - Once it's clean, take a close look at your deck to see if there is any damage that needs to be repaired. Look for cracked or splintered boards, loose nails, and other potential hazards.

3. Apply a fresh coat of stain or paint - A fresh coat of stain or paint will not only make your deck look great, but it will also help protect it from the elements.

4. Add some new furniture or accessories - Now is the perfect time to add some new furniture or accessories to your deck. A few well-placed potted plants can really brighten things up.

By following these simple tips, you can get your deck ready for spring in no time.
