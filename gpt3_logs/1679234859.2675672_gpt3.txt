Summertime is the perfect time to spruce up your home with a little bit of elbow grease—and one of the most satisfying places to start is the kitchen. After all, it’s the heart of the home, where family and friends gather to cook, eat and socialize. 

If your kitchen cabinets are looking a little tired, consider refinishing them yourself. It’s a relatively easy and budget-friendly project that can make a big impact in the overall look of your kitchen. Plus, it’s a great way to give your kitchen a facelift without undertaking a complete renovation.

Here are a few tips to get you started on your kitchen cabinet refinishing project:

1. Start with a clean slate. Thoroughly clean your cabinets with a degreaser to remove all the built-up grime. This will help ensure that your new paint or stain adheres properly.

2. Choose your products. When it comes to refinishing kitchen cabinets, you have a few different options. You can choose to paint them, stain them or use a combination of both. If you’re going for a classic look, paint is a good way to go. If you want to show off the wood grain, go for a stain. And if you can’t decide, you can always do a little of both.

3. Prep the area. Once you’ve decided on your products, it’s time to prep the area. This means protecting your countertops, floors and any other surfaces that might be susceptible to paint or stain. You’ll also want to remove all the hardware from your cabinets. This includes handles, knobs and hinges.

4. Get painting (or staining). Now for the fun part! Begin by painting or staining the cabinet doors and drawers. If you’re using paint, you’ll want to use a brush or roller to apply a primer first, followed by two coats of paint. For stain, simply apply the stain with a rag or brush and let it dry.

5. Reattach the hardware. Once the doors and drawers are dry, you can reattach the hardware. If you’re using new hardware, this is a good time to install it.

6. Stand back and admire your handiwork. Congrats—you’ve just completed a kitchen cabinet refinishing project!
