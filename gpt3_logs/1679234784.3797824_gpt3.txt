Bonney Lake Cabinet Refinishing

Fall is the perfect time to refinish your kitchen cabinets! The cooler weather means your home will be well-ventilated, and the drier air prevents your cabinets from warping during the refinishing process.

Our team of experienced cabinet refinishers can transform your kitchen in just a few days. We start by sanding down your existing cabinets to create a smooth surface. Then we apply a new coat of paint or stain, depending on your preferences.

We can also change the hardware on your cabinets to give them a fresh new look. If you’ve been wanting to update your kitchen but don’t want to spend a fortune, cabinet refinishing is a great option.

Give us a call today to schedule a free consultation. We’ll be happy to answer any questions you have and give you a quote for our services.
