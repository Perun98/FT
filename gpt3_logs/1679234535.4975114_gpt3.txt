1. Deck Painting – Autumn in Bonney Lake

As the leaves begin to change color and the days grow shorter, many of us start to think about the autumn season. For some, this means pumpkin spice lattes and cozy nights by the fireplace. For others, it’s the perfect time to get outside and enjoy the cooler temperatures.

If you’re thinking about painting your deck this autumn, Bonney Lake is the perfect place to do it! The colors of fall are absolutely beautiful, and there’s no better time to change up your outdoor space.

2. The Colors of Fall

One of the best things about painting your deck in the autumn is that you get to enjoy the stunning colors of the season. From the deep reds and oranges of the leaves to the crisp blue skies, there are endless possibilities for your color palette.

If you’re not sure where to start, consider using a warm neutral like gray or beige as your base. From there, you can add in pops of color with throw pillows, planters, and other accessories.

3. A Time for Change

The autumn season is all about change, and what better way to embrace it than by painting your deck? A fresh coat of paint can completely transform your outdoor space, and it’s the perfect way to prep for the cooler months ahead.

If you’re ready to take on this project, Bonney Lake is the perfect place to do it. With its beautiful fall colors and cooler temperatures, it’s the perfect setting for a deck refresh. So what are you waiting for? Get started today!
