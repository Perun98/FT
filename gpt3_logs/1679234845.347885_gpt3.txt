After the sanding is complete, the company will apply a primer to the cabinets. Once the primer is dry, the company will then apply the new paint or stain. Once the paint or stain is dry, the company will then re-install the doors and drawer fronts.

The whole process usually takes just a few days, and the results are truly amazing. If you’re looking for a way to give your kitchen a new lease on life, cabinet refinishing is a great option.
