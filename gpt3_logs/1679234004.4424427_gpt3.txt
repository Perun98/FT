Interior Painting in Bonney Lake

Looking for a change? Spring is the perfect time to repaint your home’s interior! A new coat of paint can brighten up any room, and it’s a relatively quick and easy project that you can do yourself.

If you’re not sure what color to paint your walls, try a neutral shade like white or beige. These colors are easy to match with furniture and décor, and they can make small spaces appear larger. If you want something a little more daring, go for a bold color like red or yellow. Just make sure you have enough light in the room, as dark colors can make rooms feel smaller.

Once you’ve chosen your color, it’s time to prep the walls. Start by removing any nails or screws, and then fill any holes with spackle. Once the spackle is dry, sand the area smooth. Then, wipe the walls down with a damp cloth to remove any dust.

Now you’re ready to paint! Start at the top of the wall and work your way down. Use a brush for the edges and a roller for the larger areas. Make sure to paint in long, even strokes. And don’t forget to paint the trim!

Once you’re finished, step back and admire your handiwork. A fresh coat of paint can make a big difference in the look and feel of your home. And it’s a project that you can be proud of, knowing you did it yourself.
